/*Check if a 2D array is a subset of another 2D array. For example:
{{1, 3}, {13, 15, 17}} is a subset of {{1, 3}, {5, 7}, {9, 11}, {13, 15, 17}}.
{{13, 15, 17},{1, 3}} is also a subset of {{1, 3}, {5, 7}, {9, 11}, {13, 15, 17}}.
{{15, 17, 13},{1, 3}} is not a subset of {{1, 3}, {5, 7}, {9, 11}, {13, 15, 17}}. */
